### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm John and I love building web applications with [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and microservices with [hapi.js](https://hapi.dev/). I also dabble in [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and all the tools surrounding it.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about web application development and microservice development
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web3 technologies with a solid profit models
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning new things about kuberentes, devops, and microservice architectures
